This repository has the relevant codes associated with the manuscript: Emergence of High Order Hubs in the Human Connectome

# Code Block 1: High Order connectivity from timeseries

input: rs-fMRI time series.
output: spreadsheet with multiple high order connectivity metrics for all combinations of metrics.

## Step 1: Block of code by Guillaume and:
## Step 2: Code by Pierre Baudot.

# Organized spreadsheet with everything. 

# Code Block 2: Computation of High-Order Hubs

Inside code: Parallel coding and storage of all 3-point connectivity of every individual. This requires information about time-series and, therefore, will not be accessible on Github.

## Step 1: Loading all High Order Connectivity

## Step 2: The second Block will actually compute High order connectivity. First I will do everything at the average level. Therefore I need:

### 1) Load all files from dropbox somehow. 
### 2) Create the average High Order connectivity for the whole cohort. 
### 3) Run the high-order connectivity script for everything.
### 4) Eventually Store all HIgh order Hubs in a Dataframe (Brainstorm this a bit more).

# Code Block 3: Data Visualization of High Order Hubs in the Human connectome.

Upload of my current working code on it. It's so detailed that I will make more steps in it while doing it.

# Code Block 4: Run High Order metrics in the whole cohort.

The same has code block 3: I will be inspired by the codes I made for Rodrigo Cofre.
